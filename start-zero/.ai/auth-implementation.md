# Better Auth Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to integrate Better Auth with a separate database while using Drizzle as the ORM, similar to the existing Zero DB setup.

## Step 1: Update Docker Configuration

- Add a new PostgreSQL service for Better Auth in `docker/docker-compose.yml`
- Configure it to run on port 5431 (not conflicting with the main DB)
- Set up volumes for persistent data storage
- Create network configuration to allow communication between services

## Step 2: Install Required Packages

```bash
# Install Better Auth and Drizzle adapter
bun add better-auth better-auth/adapters/drizzle
```

## Step 3: Environment Configuration

- Create environment variables for Better Auth in `.env` and `.env.example`
- Include variables for auth database connection
- Add secrets for Better Auth

## Step 4: Database Setup

- Create a Drizzle schema for Better Auth (`src/db/auth-schema.ts`)
- Set up database connection using Drizzle (`src/db/auth-db.ts`)
- Use Better Auth CLI to generate or migrate the schema:
  ```bash
  npx @better-auth/cli migrate
  ```

## Step 5: Better Auth Configuration

- Create the auth instance in `src/lib/auth.ts`
- Configure authentication methods (email/password initially)
- Use the Drizzle adapter with the auth database

## Step 6: API Route Handlers

- Set up API route handler at `src/routes/api/auth/[...all].ts`
- Configure it to handle all Better Auth requests
- Use the auth handler from the Better Auth instance

## Step 7: Client-Side Integration

- Create client-side auth integration (`src/lib/auth-client.ts`)
- Set up hooks and methods for authentication (signIn, signUp, etc.)
- Export necessary functions for use in components

## Step 8: UI Components

- Create login/signup forms
- Add session handling and protected routes
- Implement logout functionality

## Step 9: Testing

- Test the authentication flow end-to-end
- Verify database connections and migrations
- Check for any security issues

## Step 10: Production Considerations

- Configure secure environment variables
- Set up proper backups for the auth database
- Implement rate limiting and security features

This implementation plan provides a minimal but complete approach to adding Better Auth with a separate database while following the project's existing patterns.
